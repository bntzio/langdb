language learning tools, written in Ruby + SQLite

# IMPORTANT:

**These are meant to be run in the terminal (“command line”).**  Once you download this git repository, go into its directory in your terminal, and get ready to type things, shown below.

I'm just sharing these tools I've written for my own use, learning Esperanto from English.

So for now it's using English — “en” — as the source language, and Esperanto — “eo” — as the target language.

You can use this for any source and target language if you just think of “en” as code for “source” and “eo” as code for “target”.

# HOW TO START:

## Must have sqlite3 and ruby and Ruby's sqlite3 gem

```
sqlite3 --version
ruby -v
gem install sqlite3
```

# USAGE:

## ADD a WORD, PHRASE, or FACT

Just type “add” and you should see this:

```
add
./add:35:in `<main>': needs first word: word,phrase,fact (RuntimeError)
```

That shows you that it needs another word following it.  Either “word”, “phrase”, or “fact”

```
```

```
```

```
```

```
```
